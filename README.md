# Shopify 2019 - Waste Wizard ðŸ”®

Have you ever wondered what kind waste items go where? Let's find out together by searching the items up in the **Toronto Waste Wizard** database

### Getting Started

- First, we need to install our dependencies. A quick `yarn install` should do the trick âœ¨
- To start the app you can run `yarn run start`
    - This runs the app in development mode, you can open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view in the browser!

### Dependencies

- React: When the criteria mentioned rendering a list, I knew React was the way to go :heart:. I also decided to use React because it made sense to me that I should be using a framework that Shopify put in the Web Engineer Intern job description
- TypeScript: Makes the code easier to read, beneficial for you and me
- Redux: React is always good with a little state management
- Redux-Saga: Async actions, needed for dispatching an action to fetch data from the API and storing it in the store
- styled-components: Makes these components pretty ðŸ’…
- axios: I use this to make my API request


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
